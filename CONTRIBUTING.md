# Contributing Guidelines for [Go-Mathify](github.com/ashwin2125/go-mathify)

We welcome all contributions from the community. Before you start, please read these guidelines to ensure a smooth and effective collaboration process.

## Branching Strategy

- The `master` branch is the stable branch.
- Feel free to create branches using any name, but we recommend short descriptive names with a prefix indicating the type of work, such as:
  - `bug/` for bug fixes
  - `feat/` for new features
  - `issue/` for issues
  - `fix/` for major patches

## Issue Tracker

We use GitHub Issues for issue tracking. You can pick an existing issue to work on or create a new issue to discuss your feature or bug.

## Code Style

Please follow idiomatic Go practices for code styling. Consider running code through `go fmt` before submitting a PR.

## Test Coverage

While comprehensive test coverage is not strictly required, we do expect new code to be covered by at least basic unit tests.

## Review Process

All Pull Requests must be reviewed by the project maintainer(s) before being merged into `master`.

## Documentation

- If you're introducing a new feature, please update the `README.md` in accordance with the existing style.
- Additionally, any new features should be documented under the `/docs` directory.
